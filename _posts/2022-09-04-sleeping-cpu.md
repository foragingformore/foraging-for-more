People should sleep with people

Not computers.

We wanted space from our better half

Now we’re lost in it

Airdropped our pharmacopeia

Somewhere back on Earth

To hold tight the electronic narcotic

Now piloting our cruise

Untold chambers of neurotic erotics

Swiping right in our vestibules

Patronizing intimacy from afar

Accepting to inspect all comers

Except when and where we are

Now nothing’s more alien to us

Than getting close enough to pass around the hug drug

But there’s no pleasing the hive mind

Without powering the busy body.

A persuasive Utopia from the designers

An invasive wasteland for the makers and caretakers.

Designed on earth

Made in hell

With parts stripped from heaven’s gate

Tired of carrying clouds down the mountain

Our supply chain eliminates the wait

Intervening with irrigation

Before the first drop wets your face.

We’ve been ruled for so long

That if you left it left it up to us

We’d never choose what good for us

Unless someone showed us how.

You wanted to have it your way

Without telling anyone what that is.

Being heard won’t damage your hearing

So button down and speak up.

While they were building walls and dropping bombs

We were building a vocabulary and seeding wisdom

To dissolve even the most refined metal allies

Gone farther than we could expect to come back

So even the return will be a journey.
